//! The set of attached clients, and how a change reaches all of them. The
//! session is shared, so a change one client makes is news for every other: a
//! repository opened in the browser has to appear in an attached TUI without it
//! having asked. That rules out plain request/response — the daemon speaks
//! first — so each client gets a queue and a thread that drains it, and state
//! changes are broadcast rather than returned.
//!
//! Refusals are not broadcast. "No such directory" is an answer to the client
//! that asked and noise to everyone else.
//!
//! **Nothing here is ever skipped.** These queues carry pane output, and a
//! client that misses one frame of it renders every frame after that from a
//! corrupted stream — there is no re-reading a terminal. So a client that stops
//! keeping up is disconnected, the same trade the hub makes one layer in.
