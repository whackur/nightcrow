//! Wiring one attached client to every open repository's terminals. The hubs
//! are the browser's too — one per repository, already fanning output out to
//! whoever has connected. An attaching client subscribes to all of them at once,
//! because it renders a tab per repository and a pane whose output it stopped
//! reading would fall behind its own scrollback.
//!
//! That costs a thread per client per repository. Bounded by
//! `MAX_ATTACHED_CLIENTS` × `MAX_PROJECTS`.
