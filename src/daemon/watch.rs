//! Telling attached clients about changes nobody on their connection asked for.
//! The session has two front doors. A repository opened in the browser goes
//! through the HTTP handlers, and nothing on an attach socket is woken by it —
//! so a client that asks for nothing would sit on a tab list that quietly went
//! stale.
//!
//! This is a thread that re-reads the session on a tick and tells everyone when
//! it differs from what they were last told. Observing rather than being
//! notified, because a notification is something a mutation added later can
//! forget to send, and the failure then looks like this same bug again. The cost
//! is a comparison of a handful of small structs at a rate nobody can see.
