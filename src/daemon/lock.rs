//! The single-instance lock. Two daemons on one socket would each serve half
//! the attaching clients, and the second to bind would displace the first.
//! Deciding which is running has to be exact, which rules out asking the socket:
//! a `connect` that succeeds does not prove a listener is alive — on macOS it
//! can succeed against a socket whose listener has closed, and the reset only
//! shows up on the next read.
//!
//! An advisory lock answers instead. The kernel holds it for as long as the
//! descriptor is open and releases it when the process ends — including a
//! `kill -9`, where no cleanup code of ours runs. So holding the lock means
//! "no other daemon is live" with no race and no timeout.
