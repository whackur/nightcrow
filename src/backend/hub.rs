//! A terminal backend whose panes live in the daemon's session.
//!
//! [`PtyBackend`](super::PtyBackend) owns its children; this owns nothing and
//! asks. One per repository, all sharing the connection the client attached
//! with, so the panes it reports are the same ones the browser is looking at.
//!
//! A pane arrives as an event instead of a return value, because its id comes
//! from where the PTY actually lives. Its size is not this client's to assume.
//! VT emulation still happens here: the bytes are raw either way, so
//! `PaneEmulator` reads them from a socket exactly as it read them from a PTY.
