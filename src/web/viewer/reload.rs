//! Re-reading `config.toml` into a running session, independent of how the

//!
//! Sits beside [`session`](super::session) and for the same reason: the browser
//! reaches this over HTTP and an attached terminal over the daemon socket, and
//! both must land on exactly the same state change. Neither transport
//! authenticates here — deciding who may ask is theirs.
//!
//! **What a reload is, and what it is not.** It re-reads two tables and nothing
//! else. `[[plugin]]` reaches even the repositories that are already open,
//! because a plugin is a child process and replacing one costs the session
//! nothing. `[[startup_command]]` reaches only the repositories opened
//! afterwards: a hub creates its startup panes once for its life, and the panes
//! a running repository already spent that list on are live children that no
//! file edit may replace. Everything else in the file is read once at startup
//! and still needs a restart.
//!
//! **It does not half-apply.** The whole file is parsed and validated first, so a
//! typo anywhere leaves the session exactly as it was.
