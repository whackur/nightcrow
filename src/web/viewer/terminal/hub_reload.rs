//! Re-applying the `[[plugin]]` table on a hub that is already running.
//!
//! A plugin is a child process rather than a pane, so unlike a startup terminal
//! it can be replaced without costing the session anything a person was using.
//!
//! Three rules the diff below is written around.
//!
//! **The opt-ins are this hub's, not the new file's.** A hub creates its startup
//! panes once for its life, so a `[[startup_command]]` added by the edit has no
//! pane here and will not get one. What decides is the list this hub was spawned
//! with ([`TerminalHub::startup_commands`]).
//!
//! **A plugin that is watching something stays.** Removing a pane's opt-in from
//! the file does not remove the pane, and silently un-watching a live agent
//! terminal is worse than keeping a host the file no longer asks for. Turning
//! `enabled` off is the way to say stop; that is honoured.
//!
//! **The guard is never rebuilt.** Its relaunch budget is keyed by a pane's
//! token, which is what bounds a plugin that answers every exit with another
//! relaunch. Rebuilding it here would hand out a fresh allowance on every
//! reload, so the ceiling would never be reached.
