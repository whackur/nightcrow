//! Terminals owned by the viewer, one hub per repository.
//!
//! These are **not** the TUI's panes — the viewer owns its own [`PtyBackend`],
//! so `nightcrow serve` offers terminals with no TUI running at all.
//!
//! Raw PTY bytes go to the browser untouched. The hub does parse the stream for
//! one thing it cannot get any other way: the modes each pane's program has set,
//! which an attaching client has to be told because the bytes that set them are
//! long gone (see [`hub_modes`]).
//!
//! **Output is queued, not conflated.** Status updates can drop intermediates
//! because the newest is a complete picture; terminal bytes cannot — dropping
//! any corrupts the stream. Each client gets a bounded queue and is
//! disconnected when it overflows.
