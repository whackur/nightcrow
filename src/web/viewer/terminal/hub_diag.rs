//! Recording where a pane's screen-clearing input came from.
//!
//! This exists because of a specific unexplained event: a pane running Claude
//! Code had its conversation cleared fourteen times in five seconds. Claude Code
//! runs `/clear` when it receives `Ctrl+L` twice within two seconds, and the
//! transcript showed the clears arriving as a shortcut rather than as typed
//! input — so `0x0c` reached the pane about thirty times, at a machine-like
//! cadence, and nobody knows what sent it. nightcrow itself does not: the only
//! bytes it synthesizes are scroll and mouse reports and a plugin's `continue`,
//! and that one is logged where it happens. That leaves a client's own input.
//!
//! So this notes the arrival and its shape, and the client says what produced it
//! (`ClientMessage::ClearKeyReport`, logged in `session.rs`). Between them, the
//! next occurrence names its source instead of being reconstructed afterwards.
//!
//! **No input content is logged, ever** — only the byte's count, how much else
//! rode with it, and the timing.
