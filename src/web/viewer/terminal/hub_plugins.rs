//! The plugin side of a terminal worker: which panes a plugin may see, the
//! hosts watching them, and the slots being held open for a relaunch.
//!
//! Every field here is worker-local. A plugin can drive a pane's keyboard, so
//! none of this is reachable from a connection thread — the only way in is the
//! command queue the worker already drains, and the only way out is
//! [`crate::plugin::Guard`].
//!
//! A pane appears here only two ways: its `[[startup_command]]` named a plugin
//! by hand, or a plugin asked for it by quoting the pane's own token and the
//! guard allowed it. Neither can be reached by a plugin enumerating panes,
//! because nothing ever tells a plugin what panes exist — which is what keeps
//! "an arbitrary shell is never plugin-controlled" a property of the code.
