/// This is a backstop against a plugin that died or lost interest, so it has to
/// outlast every wait a plugin may legitimately be in the middle of. Providers
/// quote windows in hours *and* in days — a weekly quota is a real case — so a
/// value picked around the five-hour window would silently throw the pane's
/// identity away days before the wait paid off, and the relaunch it was being
/// kept for would fail. Nine days clears the longest window a bundled plugin
/// will wait out (`nightcrow-recovery`'s own clamp is eight days) with slack for
/// a reset that lands late.
///
/// Holding it that long is cheap on purpose: a token, a generation and a command
/// string. The process, its fds and its threads were let go the moment it exited
/// (see [`PtyBackend::release_process`]), and closing the pane or stopping the
/// session retires the slot immediately either way.
