//! One background thread per open repository.
//!
//! The thread owns that repository's [`SnapshotChannel`], reduces each snapshot
//! to a wire payload once, and hands it to every subscribed SSE client.
//! `SnapshotChannel` is a single-consumer `mpsc`, so the viewer spawns its own —
//! the cost of the server never referencing `App`, which is also what lets it
//! run headless.
//!
//! **Fan-out is conflated, not queued.** A subscriber that writes slowly gets
//! the newest status, never a backlog of stale ones: each holds a single slot
//! that the publisher overwrites, plus a one-deep wakeup channel that coalesces.
//! No lock here is ever held across socket I/O.
