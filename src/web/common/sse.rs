//! Server-sent events over a plain synchronous writer.
//!
//! The ordinary response builder in [`super::http`] always emits a
//! `Content-Length` and `Connection: close`, which ends the connection after
//! one body — the opposite of what a live stream needs. An SSE response
//! instead keeps the socket open and appends events until one side gives up,
//! so it writes its own head and owns the connection from then on.
//!
//! Generic over [`Write`] so the framing is unit-testable against a buffer
//! and the same code drives a real `TcpStream`.
//!
//! The framing landed ahead of its caller (the viewer's `/api/events`) so each
//! step stayed small, hence the blanket dead-code allowance; drop it once a
//! route constructs an `SseStream`.
