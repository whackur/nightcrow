# nightcrow documentation

The [top-level README](../README.md) is the tour: what nightcrow is, how to
install it, and enough usage to get a session up. Everything past that lives
here, one page per surface.

## Using nightcrow

| Page | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Getting started](getting-started.md) | Install, starting and stopping a session, attaching, startup panes |
| [Projects](projects.md) | Repository tabs, the empty state, per-project scope |
| [Views](views.md) | Status, commit log, and tree views; the notice row; the repo dialog and its directory browser |
| [Keyboard and mouse](keybindings.md) | The leader key, every binding, mouse routing |
| [Session state](session-state.md) | Recent-activity highlighting, what persists across restarts and who owns it |
| [Web viewer](web-viewer.md) | The browser surface, phone layout, authentication, frontend development |
| [Plugins](plugins.md) | The plugin boundary and the bundled `nightcrow-recovery` |
| [Configuration](configuration.md) | Every `config.toml` table, and which ones reload without a restart |
