# Session state

## Recent-activity focus indicator

Files modified within the last `hot_window_secs` seconds — whether by an agent
in a terminal pane, your editor, or a build/format script — are rendered in the
accent color (bold for the first 5 seconds, normal until the window expires).

When the file list is in focus and you have not navigated in the last 2 seconds,
the selection auto-follows to the freshest hot file so the diff updates as files
change. Manual navigation (`j` / `k` / arrows / PgUp / PgDn) immediately
suppresses auto-follow until you go idle again.

Configurable under
[`[agent_indicator]`](configuration.md#agent_indicator).

## What persists

nightcrow saves the current state on exit and restores it on the next launch —
focus position, selected file, scroll offset, active terminal pane, view mode
(status / commit log / tree), fullscreen states, commit-log drill-down position,
and tree expansion and selection.

The accent is not in that list. It belongs to the session rather than to one
repo's view state, so it lives in `~/.nightcrow/viewer.json` alongside the
viewer's other shared preferences and is not restored per repo.

The browser keeps its own half of this. Which panel each project is maximized in
is remembered per project in `viewer.json`, so a refresh comes back to the layout
you left — the browser's counterpart to the fullscreen states above, kept apart
from them because maximizing on a 40-row terminal and in a browser window are not
the same answer. It is held for 50 projects, like the TUI's — the 50 whose
arrangement was set most recently, so maximizing a fifty-first is what drops the
oldest, not merely opening one.

Everything else lands in one file, `~/.nightcrow/workspace.json` — which repos
were open, which tab was in front, and each repo's view state. Nothing is written
inside your repositories: no single repo owns the fact that others were open
beside it, and nightcrow shouldn't create directories in a project it is only
reading.

A bare `nightcrow` reopens those tabs and lands on the one that was in front,
with each project's selection and scroll where you left them. Repos that have
moved or been deleted since are skipped, with a notice saying how many. View
state is kept for the 50 most recently used repos.

## Who writes what

The two halves have two owners. The session writes which repositories are open
and which tab is in front; an attached client writes what it had selected and
scrolled, and never the tab list — detaching must not roll the session back to
one client's view of it. To start empty, close every tab before stopping the
session.
